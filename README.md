# Crime Prediction & Patrol Route Optimization in MedellÃ­n

## Overview
This project aims to enhance police patrol efficiency in MedellÃ­n by predicting high-risk crime areas and optimizing patrol routes accordingly. Using historical crime data, we train a model to estimate crime likelihood in different grid cells of the city. These predictions are visualized on an interactive map, with color-coded risk levels (e.g., red for high-risk areas).

Based on these predictions, the system generates optimized patrol routes from police stations to the high-risk locations and back, ensuring effective resource allocation.

## Features

### ðŸš¨ Crime Prediction & Visualization
- Machine learning models predict crime likelihood for each grid cell in the city.  
- An interactive map displays high-risk areas using color-coded heatmaps.  
- Historical crime trends are analyzed through charts and reports.  

### ðŸš” Patrol Route Optimization
- Routes are generated from police stations to high-risk locations and back.  
- Dynamic routing adapts based on risk levels and station jurisdictions.  
- Uses a mapping API to calculate and visualize optimal patrol paths.
